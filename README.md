# ESP8266 NodeMCU Tutorial

This code & diagrams are for the ESP8266 tutorial video on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPUg4Uw3A0E

In this internet of things project, we use the ESP8266 NodeMCU Development board to read input and send output from a browser to the chip over wifi. See the video for more details and a demo.

## Circuit Diagrams
The Fritzing files, breadboard diagrams, and circuit schematics are located in this repo.

## Where you can buy the tools and materials

[✓] MicroUSB cord (to connect the NodeMCU to your laptop) http://amzn.to/2wZhUL9

[✓] Photoresistors http://amzn.to/2xvF8dd

[✓] Jumper Wires http://amzn.to/2wZwfFQ

[✓] LEDs http://amzn.to/2wnH0zE

[✓] 10K Resistors http://amzn.to/2wZ7BXf

- OR

Instead of buying resistors and LED’s separately, it might be a good idea to get a starter kit of a variety of components so you have them on hand. There are lots on Amazon, here’s a good example of one:

You also can get a variety of components in an Arduino starter kit if you plan on doing any Arduino projects (NOTE: It does NOT include the NodeMCU board, that’s a different thing – and the kits for the NodeMCU aren’t great yet because its still new) – here’s the kit I’ve used in the past:
